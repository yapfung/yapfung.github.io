            Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three
            meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat
            Bunce, and skinny
            Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox
            and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
            they're not dealing
            with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox would never surrender.
            But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.
